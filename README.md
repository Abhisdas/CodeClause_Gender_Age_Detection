# GENDER AND AGE DETECTION
Gender Age Detection project using Python involves the use of computer vision techniques to detect the age and gender of a person from an image or video feed. The OpenCV library can be used to capture images and process them for gender and age detection. Deep learning models such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) can be used to classify the gender and age of a person based on the facial features in the image. Pre-trained models such as the OpenFace model and the ResNet model can be used for gender and age detection. The project can be extended to real-time gender and age detection using a webcam or mobile camera. This project can have various applications in security systems, marketing, and entertainment industry.
